	abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid recommender system for job seeking and recruiting websites is presented. The various interaction features designed on the website help the users organize the resources they need as well as express their interest. The hybrid recommender system exploits the job and user profiles and the actions undertaken by users in order to generate personalized recommendations of candidates and jobs. The data collected from the website is modeled using a directed, weighted, and multi-relational graph, and the 3A ranking algorithm is exploited to rank items according to their relevance to the target user. A preliminary evaluation is conducted based on simulated data and production data from a job hunting website in Switzerland.},

We benchmark our algorithm against a na\"{\i}ve Bayes classifier on the  cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general.},

Another important aspect is neglected — the match between the person and the team members in terms of interpersonal compatibility. We present a decision support system based on a relational recommendation approach for providing an automated pre-selection of candidates that fit best with future team members. The relational recommender contributes to theory by proposing an IS-supported relational approach to team staffing and to practice by offering time and cost savings for HR professionals.}

We compare a baseline method treating users and jobs as documents, where suitability is measured using cosine similarity, with a model that incorporates job transitions trained on the career progressions of a set of users. We show that the job transition model outperforms cosine similarity. Furthermore, a cascaded system combining career transitions with cosine similarity generates more recommendations of a similar quality. The analysis is conducted by examining data from 2,400 LinkedIn users, and evaluated by determining how well the methods predict users' current positions from their profiles and previous position history.},

In total 14 drivers, 15 challenges and 9 consequences of implementing and using e-recruiting has been identified. Based on these results the paper introduces a model of drivers, challenges and consequences of e-recruiting and discusses implications for research and practice. The analysis reveals that e-recruiting will reduce costs for recruitment and selection, increase the number of suitable applicants, enable time savings for both organizations and applicants and improve the corporate image. These four consequences also have been identified as major drivers of e-recruiting projects. The identified challenges include the exclusion of potential applicants, the deception of applicants in e-assessment procedures, the security of applicants' data and low qualification of applicants.},

In this paper, we present Labor Market Explorer, an interactive dashboard that enables job seekers to explore the labor market in a personalized way based on their skills and competences. Through a user-centered design process involving job seekers and job mediators, we developed this dashboard to enable job seekers to explore job recommendations and their required competencies, as well as how these competencies map to their profile. Evaluation results indicate the dashboard empowers job seekers to explore, understand, and find relevant vacancies, mostly independent of their background and age.},

However, our understanding of the complementary design choices available to managers of project-based organizations is limited. Building on both organization theory and design and project management literature this study identifies design choices available for the design of the project-based organization. Adopting the contingency perspective, it reviews the literature on project-based organizations to explore key factors that influence the design of the project-based organization in comparison with more traditional organizations. The resulting model offers a starting point for further studies on the design of the project-based organization. The study concludes by suggesting a research agenda in light of the results.}

	abstract = {Recommendation systems usually involve exploiting the relations among known features and content that describe items (content-based filtering) or the overlap of similar users who interacted with or rated the target item (collaborative filtering). To combine these two filtering approaches, current model-based hybrid recommendation systems typically require extensive feature engineering to construct a user profile. Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) provides a straightforward way to combine the two approaches through its ability to directly represent the probabilistic dependencies among the attributes of related objects. However, due to the large scale of the data used in real world recommendation systems, little research exists on applying SRL models to hybrid recommendation systems, and essentially none of that research has been applied to real big-data-scale systems. In this paper, we proposed a way to adapt the state-of-the-art in SRL approaches to construct a real hybrid job recommendation system. Furthermore, in order to satisfy a common requirement in recommendation systems (i.e. that false positives are more undesirable and therefore should be penalized more harshly than false negatives), our approach can also allow tuning the trade-off between the precision and recall of the system in a principled way. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach as well as its improved performance on recommendation precision.}

An excellent job recommender system not only enables to recommend a higher paying job which is maximally aligned with the skill-set of the current job, but also suggests to acquire few additional skills which are required to assume the new position. In this work, we created three types of information net- works from the historical job data: (i) job transition network, (ii) job-skill network, and (iii) skill co-occurrence network. We provide a representation learning model which can utilize the information from all three networks to jointly learn the representation of the jobs and skills in the shared k-dimensional latent space. In our experiments, we show that by jointly learning the representation for the jobs and skills, our model provides better recommendation for both jobs and skills. Additionally, we also show some case studies which validate our claims.},

While many qualitative efforts have been made in related fields, it still lacks quantitative ways of measuring talent competencies as well as the job’s talent requirements. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end data-driven model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely, the Person-Job Fit Neural Network (PJFNN), for matching a talent qualification to the requirements of a job. To be specific, PJFNN is a bipartite neural network that can effectively learn the joint representation of Person-Job fitness from historical job applications. In particular, due to the design of a hierarchical representation structure, PJFNN can not only estimate whether a candidate fits a job but also identify which specific requirement items in the job posting are satisfied by the candidate by measuring the distances between corresponding latent representations. Finally, the extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the performance of PJFNN in terms of Person-Job Fit prediction. Also, we provide effective data visualization to show some job and talent benchmark insights obtained by PJFNN.},
